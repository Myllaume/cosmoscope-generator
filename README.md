# Cosmocope generator

GitHub repository template to generate exports with [Cosma](https://github.com/graphlab-fr/cosma).

For each commit on branch "master", a new export is generated by GitHub action script (`/.github/workflows/main.yml`).

## Bibliograhpy

Add your Zotero public group URL on file `/bibliography.js`. Then execute command `sh install.sh` to download and generate bibliographic files.

You can also ignore bibliography: delete line `node bibliography.js` from `/install.sh` and `prestart` from npm sripts from `/package.json`.

## Commands

```bash
npm start # generate cosmoscope
npm add # add new record
```
